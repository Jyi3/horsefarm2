INTRODUCTION

The CVHR Training Management System is a web-based application that provides database and management for Central Virginia Horse Rescue.

https://centralvahorserescue.org/

The application stores horses, behaviors, and trainers. It also allows admins to assign trainers to horses and horses to behaviors.

Trainers can add notes on their training sessions with horses. 

The overall goal of the application is to provide a centralized place to CVHR staff to track:
    1. Who trains which horse
    2. Which horse(s) is(are) learning which behaviors(s)
